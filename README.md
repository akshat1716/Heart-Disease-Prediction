# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Developed a deep learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Preprocessed and split data into training and testing sets, built a neural network with two hidden layers, and achieved ~85â€“90% accuracy.
